     More about me
    </h2>

    <p>
      I'm a sophomore Broadcast & Digital Journalism major at Syracuse University. I'm originally from Arlington, Virginia right outside of Washington, D.C.

     </p>
     Outside of school I write, edit and cover the Syracuse football team for The Daily Orange, and like to work out and spend time with friends.
