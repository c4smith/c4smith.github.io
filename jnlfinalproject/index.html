		<p> <span class="firstcharacter">J</span>aPharii Jones was sleeping in the passenger seat of his car in 2008 when he woke up with a flashlight in his eye. A Norfolk, Virginia police officer was asking him for his social security number, and before Jones knew it, he was taken out of the car and charged with obstruction of justice and public intoxication. Jones’ phone was broken in the process, too. </p>


<p> Since Jones was on probation at the time, he said he was forced to plead guilty to the charges, since it was the officer’s word against his. Jones has since been arrested two more times by Norfolk police. The activist has disagreed with the police’s story in each case, and argued they have treated him differently because he is Black. The relationship between Norfolk citizens and the city’s police force is “not good at all,” Jones said. </p>

<p> “They're not very friendly,” Jones said. “They’re, in my opinion, very abusive to Black and Brown citizens. And they definitely need some reprimand soon and very soon.” </p>

<p> Jones cited his arrests as an example of the harsher treatment Norfolk police officers give to Black and Hispanic people in comparison to white people. Sworn personnel in the Norfolk Police Department are 70% white and just 19% Black according to <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/13news-now-investigates/police-department-demographics-2020/291-21df6992-8f38-402c-884a-ec10228561d8">2020 data,</a> while Norfolk as a city is over 40% Black, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/norfolkcityvirginia/PST045219">U.S. Census records </a> show. Norfolk’s crime rate is the <a href="https://richmondalarm.com/security-tips/most-dangerous-cities-virginia">ninth-highest</a> in the state of Virginia, and is 57% higher than the U.S. average, putting pressure on the city’s police force. </p>

<p> Norfolk’s City Government created a <a href="https://data.norfolk.gov/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Use-of-Force-and-Citizen-Complai/fcqe-uvnb/data">public dataset</a> over the summer that provides detailed information about each reported incident of police force or citizen complaints about police behavior dating back to late 2016. That dataset shows incidents were much more likely to involve at least one Black citizen and at least one white police officer, and displays most incidents occurring in the minority-dominated zip codes near downtown Norfolk. Rarely are Norfolk police injured in the reported incidents of force when compared to citizens, too. </p>

<iframe title="Number of citizen and police officer injuries after incidents of police force in Norfolk, Virginia Depicted is the number of citizens and officers who have been injured and/or sent to the hospital after incidents of police force or complaints of police behavior in Norfolk, Virginia." aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-VKN8J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VKN8J/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="264"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<p> </p>

<p> The data showed that incidents were 3.5 times more likely to involve a Black civilian than a white one. Norfolk, however, is 47% white as a city. Additionally, incidents were over 4.7 times more likely to include a white police officer than a Black one. </p>

<p> The racial biases in this dataset and in policing in general are likely unsurprising to most people, Syracuse University psychology professor Leonard Newman said. Newman has previously researched how civilians spontaneously respond to police officers to understand what affects the type of interactions that ensue. While noting that most people have a fearful and anxious reaction when seeing police, he’s found that Black participants in the studies have always had more negative attitudes toward police than white participants. </p>

<p> “There are studies showing that if somebody behaves in an ambiguous way … and it's unclear to you why they're doing that, that there is a bias among police officers to interpret that behavior as more threatening and menacing when it is a Black person doing that,” Newman said. “This is sort of an automatic, spontaneous reaction that police officers have.” </p>

<p> After several nationwide protests — including ones in Norfolk — were held in 2020 after the deaths of George Floyd and other Black individuals at the hands of police, the Norfolk City Council <a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/new-online-resource-makes-policing-data-in-norfolk-available-to-public"> passed a resolution</a> to improve the transparency of its police department. The dataset was published this past summer, and is updated every weekday. Multiple requests for more detailed insight from Norfolk Open Data (the publisher) and the Norfolk Police Department weren’t returned. </p>

<p> Four of the listed incidents include citizen deaths at the hands of police officers. Each of those deaths occurred from an officer shooting the civilian, and two included the officer suffering injuries, the data shows. Three of the four citizens who died were Black, and eight of the 11 combined officers who were involved were white. In just one incident did the citizen have a weapon. The other three were listed as “accident investigation,” “other” or “violent felony.” Two occurred in 2017, and two in 2020. No data shows whether there have been police fatalities in the reported incidents. </p>

<p> An analysis of the dataset combined with the most recent available information on Norfolk population and demographic information showed zip codes with larger Black populations — but not necessarily higher total populations — having more incidents of police force or citizen complaints than zip codes with smaller Black populations. </p>

<p> The 23504 zip code located near downtown Norfolk, for example, is just the fifth-most populous zip code in Norfolk, according to the most recent <a href="https://www.city-data.com/zipmaps/Norfolk-Virginia.html"> data available.</a> But it also has the highest Black population of any <a href="https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/23504/"> zip code </a> in the city with nearly 90% of its residents being Black. Per the police dataset, the zip code had the second-highest number of police force or citizen complaint incidents since 2016 with 368 reported. That number only trails the adjacent 23502 zip code, which has the seventh-highest population out of Norfolk zip codes, but has the third-largest minority population with over 51% of its residents being Black. That zip code has had 406 incidents, according to the dataset. Nearly 30% of all reported incidents occurred in these two zip codes. </p>

  "They're not very friendly," Jones said. "They’re, in my opinion, very abusive to Black and brown citizens."
</div>

<p> </p>

<p> The relationship between police and citizens extends beyond these zip codes and into the rest of Norfolk, too. An analysis of the dataset shows civilians throughout the city are much more likely to be injured and sent to the hospital than officers are. The data showed 954 citizens have been sent to the hospital after incidents with police that involved physical force or a complaint about the officer’s behavior, while only 58 Norfolk officers have been hospitalized. Additionally, 604 citizens have been injured compared to 260 officers, showing that incidents with police are statistically more likely to hurt citizens than Norfolk police officers. </p>

<p> Citizens were also more likely to be injured in minority-dominated zip codes. Out of the four areas where citizens have suffered the most injuries at the hands of police, three also led the city in highest percentage of Black residents, including the 23504 zip code (129 citizen injuries) and 23502 (144). Nearly 29% of the citizens who have been sent to the hospital after incidents with Norfolk police have been from either the 23502 or 23504 zip codes, the data shows. </p>

<p> When asked how Norfolk’s Police Department could improve, and if it needed more diversity that properly reflected the demographics of the city, Jones quickly responded “they need to be defunded.” He said he sees Black people “abused” the most by police, followed by Hispanic residents, but regardless of the race of the police officer — Black or white — Norfolk officers have been abusive. </p>

<p> “They're overly aggressive when they don't get their way,” Jones said. “They will get physical with you and trump up charges and not really do anything to combat the actual violence.” </p>
